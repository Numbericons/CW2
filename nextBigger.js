function nextBigger(n) {

}

//idea 1: check all possible permutations of numbers that can be made from digits
//  see which is next largest of possiblities
//  could take index of initial number and take next, if it exists
//

//simple examples we can just switch the last 2 digits and see if that is larger


//test cases to think through problem:
//  1010
//   560  => 650
// 1200
